## 📊 Insights and Key Findings

- 🌍 **Top Countries:** Most responses came from the US, India, and Germany.
- 👨‍💻 **Developer Type:** Majority are professional full-time developers; many also code as a hobby.
- 🎓 **Education:** Most respondents hold a Bachelor's degree, mainly in CS or related fields.
- 💰 **Salaries:** Since there wasn't any exclusive column for the salary distribution of the respondents, insights of salary coudn't be derived.
- 📅 **Age Started Coding:** A significant number of developers began coding between the ages of 12 and 18, highlighting early exposure to technology during adolescence.
- 🧠 **Learning Methods:** Stack Overflow, online documentation, and video tutorials are top learning sources.
- 😊 **Job Satisfaction:** Majority are satisfied but open to better opportunities.
