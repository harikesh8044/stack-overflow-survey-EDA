# Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2020 - Data Analytics Project

This project explores and analyses the Stack overflow Developer Survey 2020 dataset, which contains response from over 65,000(approx) developers across the globe. 

The Aim is to derive meaningful insights about developer demographics, salary trends,education levels, technologies used, and more.

## Project Objective

- Understand global developer demographics 
- Analyze job satisfaction, compensation, and education. 
- Discorver trends in programming languages, frameworks, and tools 
- Practice exploratory data analysis(EDA) using python

## Dataset

- **Source:** [Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2020](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020)
- **Files Used:**
  - `survey_results_public.csv`: Main dataset with responses
  - `survey_results_schema.csv`: Description of each question/column

---

## Technologies & Tools 

- **Python**
  - `Pandas` - Data wrangling
  - `Numpy`  - Numerical computation
  - `Matplotlib` & `Seaborn` - Visualizations
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Git & GitHub** - Version Control and colloboration

## Insights and Key Findings 
- **Global Participation:** Most responses came from the US, India, and Germany, reflecting a diverse developer community.
- **Professional Background:** Majority are full-time developers; many also engage in coding as a hobby. 
- **Education:** Most respondents hold at least a Bachelor's degree, mainly in computer science or related fields. 
- **Coding Start Age:** Many developers started coding between the age of 12-18, which shows the early exposure towards technologies. 
- **Learning Resources:** Developers most commonly rely on Stack Overflow, official documentation and online courses for learning. 
- **Job Satisfaction:** Many developers report being satisfied with their current roles, though a significant portion are open to new opputunities. 
- **Compensation Data:** The 2020 data set does not include the Salary or Compensation information, so financial background coudn't be analyzed as the part of study.

## Personal Learnings 

- Strengthened my **data wrangling and visualization** skills using real-world, unstructured data.
- Learned to handle **missing values** and **categorical columns** efficiently.
- Developed a data-driven storytelling mindset, interpreting trends with clarity and logic.
- Understood how **community learning** and **technology choices** shape a developer's journey.

## Sample Visualizations
You can check out charts and plots inside the jupyter notebook:
  - Bar plots showing top countries by number of respondents. 
  - Histograms showing the Age group of the respondents 
  - Pie charts on Gender distribuitons, education and employement Type. 


**Note: To preserve the original dataset, an aliased version of the Dataframe has been created for further more analysis in the jupyter notebook**
